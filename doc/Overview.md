✅ 📌 Project Overview (Perfect for Assignment Submission)

This project is a modern, responsive personal portfolio website created using pure HTML5 and CSS3, without any external frameworks or JavaScript libraries. The goal of the portfolio is to visually present my skills, projects, and contact details in a clean, attractive, and professional layout that reflects my learning and understanding of front-end development.

The website follows a blue–white theme using custom CSS variables, smooth transitions, soft shadows, and rounded UI components. It uses Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout management and includes subtle animations such as hover effects, card elevation, and automatic project image transitions.

The portfolio consists of major sections such as a hero banner, about section, skills grid, project showcase with CSS animation, contact form, and a footer. It also includes a sticky navigation bar, smooth-scrolling behavior, and a floating “Back to Top” button.

This project demonstrates my understanding of responsive design, component styling, custom animations, and overall web page structure—making it a strong base for future front-end development projects.
